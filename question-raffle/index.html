      <h2>Salaam Alaikum,</h2>
      <p>This year we are introducing a brand new and very exciting aspect to BlockBusters, the ability for participants and the general public to create and submit questions. These questions will be entered into our collection and will be used in the playoff rounds. For every question entered, you will receive one raffle submission. The more questions you submit the greater your chances of winning our amazing prizes! Tier 1 competitors are in luck! For those teams clinching a spot in
the playoffs, you have the opportunity to gain an automatic spot into the semi-finals as well! The two teams with the most number of points and the most number of submitted questions will be awarded a bye into the semi finals!</p>
      <p>Alhamdulillah, this year we had over 100 participants join us in both tiers for our competition. With the second day of the preliminary round this Saturday June 18, 2016 approaching fast, teams are neck in neck! All teams were divided into pools, three pools in tier 1 and four pools in tier 2. In each pool, the top two teams will advance into the playoffs. In tier 1, six teams in total will advance in the competition, of which two out of the six teams will receive a bye and
automatically qualify for the semi-finals. There are two ways a team can receive a bye, the first is attaining the highest # of points within the tier, and the second being the team that submits the most # of questions. In tier 2, eight teams will advance in the competition, of which all eight teams will compete in the quarter finals before moving forward.</p>
      <p>In order for your submission to count, you must ensure that your questions follow these key points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Questions should all be verified for accuracy – the answers to all submitted questions must be correct and unambiguous. If we find that your question or answer is incorrect or arguable, your entry will not count.</li>
        <li>Questions must be stated and worded clearly and abide by the BlockBusters format: “What A …” or “What B …”.
          <ul><li>E.g. “What B is white when it is dirty?”</li></ul></li>
        <li>All questions submitted must be appropriate to a Masjid setting. Acceptable topics include religion, sports, science, art, history, geography, and any general knowledge. Questions that are inappropriate or controversial to a mosque setting will not count towards the raffle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can enter the new raffle by heading to the question submission form on our website at: <a href="http://blockbusterstrivia.com/question-raffle" target="_blank">www.blockbusterstrivia.com/question-raffle</a></p>
      <p>Thank you for your continued support and cooperation throughout the competition. We would like to wish you all the best of luck and hope to see all of you tomorrow for the next round of BlockBusters!</p>
      <p>With Du’as,</p>
      <p>The JCC BlockBusters Team</p>
